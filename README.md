    ðŸ‘‹ Hi,
# Iâ€™m Frank Wu
# Education
- Huazhong University of Science and Technology ï¼ˆbachelor)
- Shanghai Jiao Tong University (master)
# Interests
- ðŸ‘€ I specialize in research related to deep learning and its applications in image processing, particularly in semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, `weakly-` and `semi-supervised segmentation` algorithms, and 3D segmentation.
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focusing on `3D mesh segmentation`, exploring both fully supervised and weakly-supervised approaches.
- ðŸ‘€ Additionally, I am actively learning about NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and its applications in computer vision.
- ðŸŒ± I am hoping to secure a `PhD offer` from North America to further advance my research in these areas.
