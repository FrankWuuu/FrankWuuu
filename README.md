- 👋 # Hi, I’m @FrankWuuu
- 👀 I specialize in research related to deep learning and its applications in image processing, particularly in semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, `weakly-` and `semi-supervised segmentation` algorithms, and 3D segmentation.
- 🌱 Currently, I am focusing on `3D mesh segmentation`, exploring both fully supervised and weakly-supervised approaches.
- 👀 Additionally, I am actively learning about NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and its applications in computer vision.
- 🌱 I am hoping to secure a PhD offer from North America to further advance my research in these areas.
